***What this blog is used for?***

This blog is mainly used to record my life, I hope it will be an alternative "memory".

To be honest, I've been thinking about writing blogs for a while. However, until now, I actually started building this website and starting my own blogging life. I'd like to share what happened in my life, what I have learned, what I have experienced with people I love and people who loved me, even strangers.







***尽力而为！！！***
